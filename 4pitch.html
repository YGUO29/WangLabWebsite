                                <p> <b>(Song et al., 2016)</b> Complex pitch perception serves a pivotal role in human audition, especially in speech and music perception. It has been suggested that pitch perception mechanisms demonstrated in humans are not shared by nonhuman species. Here we provide evidence that a New World monkey, the common marmoset, shares all primary features of complex pitch perception mechanisms with humans. Combined with previous findings of a specialized pitch processing region in both marmoset and human auditory cortex, this evidence suggests that pitch perception mechanisms likely originated early in primate evolution.</p>

                                <p><b>(Osmanski et al., 2013)</b> Pitch is one of the most fundamental percepts in the auditory system and can be extracted using either spectral or temporal information in an acoustic signal. Although pitch perception has been extensively studied in human subjects, it is far less clear how nonhuman primates perceive pitch. We have addressed this question in a series of behavioral studies in which marmosets, a vocal nonhuman primate species, were trained to discriminate complex harmonic tones differing in either spectral (fundamental frequency f0) or temporal envelope (repetition rate) cues. We found that marmosets used temporal envelope information to discriminate pitch for acoustic stimuli with higher-order harmonics and lower f0 values and spectral information for acoustic stimuli with lower-order harmonics and higher f0 values. We further measured frequency resolution in marmosets using a psychophysical task in which pure tone thresholds were measured as a function of notched noise masker bandwidth. Results show that only the first four harmonics are resolved at low f0 values and up to 16 harmonics are resolved at higher f0 values. Resolvability in marmosets is different from that in humans, where the first five to nine harmonics are consistently resolved across most f0 values, and is likely the result of a smaller marmoset cochlea. In sum, these results show that marmosets use two mechanisms to extract pitch (harmonic templates [spectral] for resolved harmonics, and envelope extraction [temporal] for unresolved harmonics) and that species differences in stimulus resolvability need to be taken into account when investigating and comparing mechanisms of pitch perception across animals.</p>

A, Resolvability boundaries for both marmosets (solid black line) and humans (dashed black line) derived from psychophysical ERB estimates. Harmonics falling to the left of each boundary are fully resolved, whereas harmonics falling to the right are unresolved or partially resolved. Compared with humans, marmosets have poorer spectral resolution less than 300 Hz. Marmosets can fully resolve up to 12 harmonics at 400 Hz, a result that matches results from Experiment 1 where temporal envelope cues were no longer salient for H1–H9 or H4–H12 stimuli ∼>450 Hz. B, Comparison of harmonic resolvability for marmosets using both behavioral data and tuning bandwidths of neurons recorded from A1.

                            <p><b>(Bendor and Wang, 2005)</b> Pitch perception is critical for identifying and segregating auditory objects1, especially in the context of music and speech. The perception of pitch is not unique to humans and has been experimentally demonstrated in several animal species2, 3. Pitch is the subjective attribute of a sound's fundamental frequency (f 0) that is determined by both the temporal regularity and average repetition rate of its acoustic waveform. Spectrally dissimilar sounds can have the same pitch if they share a common f 0. Even when the acoustic energy at f 0 is removed ('missing fundamental') the same pitch is still perceived1. Despite its importance for hearing, how pitch is represented in the cerebral cortex is unknown. Here we show the existence of neurons in the auditory cortex of marmoset monkeys that respond to both pure tones and missing fundamental harmonic complex sounds with the same f 0, providing a neural correlate for pitch constancy1. These pitch-selective neurons are located in a restricted low-frequency cortical region near the anterolateral border of the primary auditory cortex, and is consistent with the location of a pitch-selective area identified in recent imaging studies in humans4, 5.</p>
